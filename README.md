# golden-commits

simple guideline on how to write good commit messages

## The Golden Circle

I assume you know the "Golden Circle" model, invented by Simon Sinek.
In case you don't I highly recommend to watch his [Talk "How great leaders inspire action"](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

## Golden Commits

When creating a commit log we can increase its value imensly by following the same guidance.

 1. **WHY** do I change something (code/documentation)
 2. **HOW** do I achieve this goal 
 3. **WHAT** do I do
 
Firstly we should always ask these questions before starting to actually change something
And then, secondly we can utilise the same questions to create a great commit message.

 1. Commit message header: **WHAT** have I done (brief sumrary)
 2. Changeset: **HOW** have I achieved it
 3. Commit message body: **WHY** have I introduced this change (longer description + references)
